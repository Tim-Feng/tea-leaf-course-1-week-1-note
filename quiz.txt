Week 1 Quiz
What is the value of a after the below code is executed?
a = 1
b = a
b = 3
a => 1
What's the difference between an Array and a Hash?
Array => Index and value
Hash => key and value

Every Ruby expression returns a value. Say what value is returned in the below expressions:

=>[1, 2, 3, 3]

[1, 2, 3, 3].uniq
=>[1, 2, 3]

[1, 2, 3, 3].uniq!
=>[1, 2, 3]

What's the difference between the map and select methods for the Array class? Give an example of when you'd use one versus the other.
map => Invokes the given block once for each element of self. map { |item| block } â†’ new_ary
select => Returns a new array containing all elements of ary for which the given block returns a true value. select { |item| block } â†’ new_ary

Say you wanted to create a Hash. How would you do so if you wanted the hash keys to be String objects instead of symbols?
hash[string] = value
hash[:a, 10 :b, 20]

What is returned?
x = 1
x.odd? ? "no way!" : "yes, sir!"
=> x = 1

What is x?
x = 1
3.times do
  x += 1
end
puts x
What is x?
3.times do
  x += 1
end
puts x

x = 4
